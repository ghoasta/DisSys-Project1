I have decided to make file calculations.py singleton as we should have only one instance of this class to make calculation as we will have only one game <br />
I was not able to implement other patter as I was struggling with it <br />
I know there are a typos in proto file "Work" instead of "Word" but I am afraid to fix it now as this might crash the app<br />
The code is available on my github: https://github.com/ghoasta/DisSys-Project1
